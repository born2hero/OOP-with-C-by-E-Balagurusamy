/*
Improve the system design in Exercise 6.3 to incorporate the following features:
a) The price of books should be updated as and when required. Use a private member function to implement
    this
b) The stock value of each book should be automically updated as soon as a transaction is completed.
c) The number of successful and unsuccessful transactions should be recorded for the purpose of 
    statistical analysis. Use static data members to keep count of transactions.
