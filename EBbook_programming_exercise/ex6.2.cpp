/*
Define a class String that could work as a user-defined string type. Include Constructors that will enable
us to create an uninitialized string
String s1;  // string with length 0
and also to initialize an object with a string constant at the time of creation.
String s2("Well done!");
Include a function that adds two string to make a third string.. Note that the statment
s2=s1;
will be perfectly reasonable expression to copy one string to another.

Write a complete program to test your class to see that it does the following tasks:

a) Creates uninitialized string objects
b) Creates object with string constants
c) Concatenates two strings properly
d) Displays a desired string object
